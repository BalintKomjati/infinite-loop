### Credits

 - Original idea and 1st version of the notebook was created by [hardmaru](https://github.com/hardmaru)
 - Thereafter [BalintKomjati](https://github.com/BalintKomjati) made the following improvements:
    - Adopted to run on Google Colab
    - Introduced "interpolation" between outpainted images to create smoother videos. This allows to use wider outpainting masks which tend to generate larger coherent structures, without unpleasant jumps between frames.
    - Put the whole product into a intuitive, user friendly notebook (at least that was the intention :) )


### Backlog of potential improvements (contributions are welcome):

 - AUTOMATIC1111 integration
 - Add the possibility for the output to "drift" between prompts (now uses the same prompt for all images with different seed)
 - Fix the issue that any resolution higer than 512 will drastically decrease the network's imagination resulting the generated video rather boring. (e.g. upscale after each inpainting step?)
 - Make movement in the video more realistic without "fisheye" distorsions
 - Possibility to change movement of the camera during video (e.g. turns in any direction)
 - Generate video in non-cubic resolution (now only cubic is possible)
