### Credits

 - Original idea and 1st version of the notebook was created by [hardmaru](https://github.com/hardmaru)
 - Thereafter [BalintKomjati](https://github.com/BalintKomjati) made the following improvements:
    - Adopted to run on Google Colab
    - Introduced "interpolation" between outpainted images to create smoother videos. This allows to use wider outpainting masks which tend to generate larger coherent structures, without unpleasant jumps between frames.
    - Put the whole product into a intuitive, user friendly notebook (at least that was the intention :) )
